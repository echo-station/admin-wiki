# Policies

As administrators, it's our job to make sure everyone has fun. We carry a lot
of responsibility to be impartial, treat rule infractions equally, and correct people proportionally.

This page is dedicated to being a **guideline**, and **not** a "book of absolute truths" for how to react to various situations. Every situation is unique in some way.

## Policy 1. Warn players first

Often times a players' first rules infractions are caused by ignorance and/or getting caught up in the moment. Most of the time it's appropriate to simply [bwoink](../tools/ahelp.md) them with a warning:

> redmushie: Hey, you're breaking rule R6, don't self antag. Making that chem is considered antagonistic behavior.
> 
> player: oh shit sorry, i didn't know that
> 
> redmushie: All good

Naturally, this is entirely dependent on the nature of the rule break. Zero-tolerance rules warrant harsher responses.

## Policy 2. Use hidden notes by default

Admin [noting](../tools/noting.md) is a great tool to keep track of which admin has warned, reprimanded or punished players previously. **However, public notes come with a drawback.** Many people may feel that getting noted for something small or for genuine mistakes is unfair. Naturally, this is not our intent -- as admins we just want to keep track!

Therefore, as a rule of thumb, our default policy is to write **hidden** notes, so long as we're not talking about a major infraction.

## Policy 3. When admining, prefer fullmin over halfmin

The terminology "fullmin" and "halfmin" mean the following:

- Fullmin is when you are *fully admin*, i.e. in admin mode (`readmin`) and observing as admin ghost (`aghost`).
- Halfmin what we call being admined and playing a character **at the same time**.

Being halfmin is **strongly discouraged**. Both IC interactions and administrator interactions can take up a lot of your time, especially if you need to verify claims from players in [ahelps](../tools/ahelp.md).

There are just many, many problems with being a halfmin:

- You may **fail** to meet your IC job standards.
- You may have to **interrupt RP** to perform admin duties.
- You may have to **delay admin duties** to handle IC emergencies (spacings, antags, ..)
- You may obtain information that you should not have, such as:
    - Admin messages like `User ZZZ caused C4 to explode at (xxx, yyy)`
    - Players can [ahelp](../tools/ahelp.md) you and provide information your character does not know

/// admonition | Tip
    type: tip
**As a rule of thumb**, if there are five or more players (not counting yourself), you should fullmin if no other admin is on duty.

## Policy 4. If multiple admins are ingame, one should fullmin

As stated in [Policy 3](#policy-3-when-admining-prefer-fullmin-over-halfmin), administrating  up a lot of your time. As such, if multiple admins are online, **one admin should fullmin**. Decide amongst yourselves who will fullmin. The other is then available to play normally.

## Policy 5. Be ready to fill in

Personal things come up all the time. If you are `deadmin`ed and playing while another admin is fullmin, and they suddenly have to leave, you should probably cryo and go fullmin yourself.

You should decide what's best for the game. Use the rule of thumb of [Policy 3](#policy-3-when-admining-prefer-fullmin-over-halfmin) if you need to.
