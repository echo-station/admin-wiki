Echo Station aims to be inbetween Medium RolePlay (MRP) and High RolePlay (HRP). To faciliate this we require players to be server whitelisted (this page), and optionally even [Role whitelisted](./role.md).

# Design philosophy

As we're aiming for a medium-to-high roleplay experience, ensuring we only whitelist people that are a good fit and capable of roleplaying is an important aspect. However, whitelisting is a big barrier to throw up before 

# Mechanics

Before we go into process, it's important you understand how the server whitelist works **mechanically** speaking.

When someone tries to connect to the server, the logical process is roughly as follows:

- Is the user banned? :x: They may not connect.
- Is the user an admin? :white_check_mark: They may connect.
- Is the server full? :x: They may not connect.
- Is the user server whitelisted? :white_check_mark: They may connect.
- Is the user not whitelisted?
    - Count the amount of online and **active** administrators. (`deadmin`ed administrators not count!)
    - Multiply this amount by `2`, limited to at most `5`.
    - You now know how many **tryout slots** there are.
    - Count the amount of players that **are** connected, but not whitelisted.
    - Subtract these numbers: `(amount of tryout slots) - (currently connected non-whitelisted users) = available tryout slots`
    - If `available tryout slots` is :x: They may not connect.

## Tryout slots

The concept of "tryout slots" exists on Echo to improve server visibility and let players get a shot at trying the server before applying for whitelist.

Mechanically speaking, tryout slots is configured by the following parameters (bear with me!):
